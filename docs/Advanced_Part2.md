Using the multiprocessing module for shared memory and queues:
```
import multiprocessing

def producer(queue):
    for i in range(10):
        queue.put(i)

def consumer(queue):
    while True:
        item = queue.get()
        print(f"Consumed: {item}")
        queue.task_done()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    queue = multiprocessing.Queue()
    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=producer, args=(queue,))
    c = multiprocessing.Process(target=consumer, args=(queue,))
    p.start()
    c.start()
    queue.join()  # Wait for all items to be processed
    p.join()
    c.join()


```

Function Decorators
```
import functools

def log_function_call(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with arguments {args} and keyword arguments {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_function_call
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
add(3, 5)

```
